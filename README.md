# FPGA Leds Racer

## Description

A fun little game, 4 players (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) around a table, each with an arcade button, must challenge each other by pressing their button as fast as possible.

Pressing the button causes their led to progress to the center circle. The first to reach the center wins.

## Hardware

I'm putting here the material I used for the project, but of course if it's compatible this list can be adapted.

- 4 x **Arcade buttons** (https://www.amazon.fr/EG-STARTS-Nouveau-Boutons-poussoirs-lumineux/dp/B01MSNXLN0/)
- 1 x **LEDs Circles (with WS2812B Leds)** (https://www.amazon.fr/Treedix-anneaux-WS2812B-adressable-Raspberry/dp/B0CD3DYJRK/)
- 1 x **FPGA DE0 Nano** (https://www.mouser.fr/ProductDetail/Terasic-Technologies/P0082?qs=ePbE9GiMmvUo6nLfdjJv4g%3D%3D)

## Software IDE

I'm putting here the software I use for development to date. It's possible that these technical considerations may change depending on the target material.

- Quartus Prime Lite
- Questa Sim

## Actual State
**49** Logic Element (LE) - **27** Registers

I concentrated mainly on implementing the WS2812B LED driver. With the help of the testbench tool, I implemented tests as I went along in order to discover the communication algorithm with the WS2812B LED serial line. 
This enabled me to optimize the number of registers and logic elements used (120 to 51 LE).

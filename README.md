# FPGA Leds Racer

## Description

A fun little game, 4 players (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) around a table, each with an arcade button, must challenge each other by pressing their button as fast as possible.

Pressing the button causes their led to progress to the center circle. The first to reach the center wins.

## Hardware

I'm putting here the material I used for the project, but of course if it's compatible this list can be adapted.

- 4 x **Arcade buttons** (https://www.amazon.fr/EG-STARTS-Nouveau-Boutons-poussoirs-lumineux/dp/B01MSNXLN0/)
- 1 x **LEDs Circles (with WS2812B Leds)** (https://www.amazon.fr/Treedix-anneaux-WS2812B-adressable-Raspberry/dp/B0CD3DYJRK/)
- 1 x **FPGA DE0 Nano** (https://www.mouser.fr/ProductDetail/Terasic-Technologies/P0082?qs=ePbE9GiMmvUo6nLfdjJv4g%3D%3D)

## Software IDE

I'm putting here the software I use for development to date. It's possible that these technical considerations may change depending on the target material.

- Quartus Prime Lite
- Questa Sim

## Actual State
**248** Logic Element (LE) - **133** Registers

I concentrated mainly on implementing the WS2812B LED driver. With the help of the testbench tool, I implemented tests as I went along in order to discover the communication algorithm with the WS2812B LED serial line.

the project works correctly End to End with DE0 Nano device.

The next step of the development could manage the initial Menu screen, to allow players to join the game level, we just try to reproduce [this MicroPython implementation](https://github.com/KerCrafter/micropython-leds-racer).

The end of game level isn't totally implemented, at this stage it seems Player can continue to up to next position, even after the game level is finished: Need to lock others players.

Also from game finished screen, we should implement a delay to restart game level.

### Identified problems / todo

- [Electronic Experimentation] Too much clk edges required to debounce button, it could be interesting to test with a capacitor.
- WS2812B Driver, not implement frame validation (RET code) according to the DataSheet, should be LOW during **Treset** = Above 50Âµs.
- From Test Bench we identify a problem about the RED Player led seems move two positions direcly : it's described in [LEDs_racer_main_tb](./LEDs_racer_main_tb.vhd#L414) / [this doc](./docs/sim_counter_problem.md)
- Not explain why all players seems start in the Second LED in DE0 Nano device, I suspect it caused by initial state in pins before injecting wireing configuration of LEDs Racer (need to verify physically this case).

## Schematic

### Buttons

Should be connected to the FPGA inputs with a pull down resistor (note: not sure 1M is an ideal value)
